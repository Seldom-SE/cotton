# Cotton

![Cotton](screenshot.png)

Cotton is an open source board game in the vain of Settlers of Catan, written in Bevy.
It's a side project and a bit of an experiment.
I'm avoiding using states and events, since I tend to use them a lot.
When this is done, I might fork it into a private repo and make a bit more of my own game.
Feel free to do the same!
